### Computational Workflows | Engineering Simulation, Energy & Software-Oriented Work

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am an **Architect with an M.Sc. in Building Structures and a Ph.D. in Architecture**, with applied experience in **simulation-driven workflows and software tools for energy efficiency**.

My work focuses on bridging **engineering domain knowledge** and **computational methods**, translating complex technical problems into structured, reproducible workflows. I have experience with MATLAB, LaTeX, Lua, SQL, and scripting, and I am currently expanding my programming skills in Python to strengthen software-oriented workflows.
